# A laboratory-repo in Java
### Context
Most of the code here are written for university activities/assignments/quizzes/maybe even exams because they use Java in uni and I thought it was a good idea to just shove some (not all) of the material here. With that said, a lot of the activities are missing.

### Contents

* Fundamentals of Programming
* (not really) Intermediate Programming 
* Data Structures and Algorithms 
* OOP Reviewer 


### IMPORTANT NOTE:
I used IDEA to generate most of these folders so you may get tons of errors when you try to run these, you can run them as an IDEA Project, otherwise, **I highly recommend to just copy the src files/code and run them wherever you like**.
